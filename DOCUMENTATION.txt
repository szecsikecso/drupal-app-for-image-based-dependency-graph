I've based my excersise development on a new Drupal 8.9.7 installation.

I've installed drupal/console for code generation,
which is not compatible with Composer 2.0 so I've rollbacked my composer to 1.x

With Composer 1.x I've run into memory issue so I could use composer with prefix:
COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1

README
------

- Please run "composer install" before executing the web application
- For the 3rd excercise there are more steps to do for setup - see Section Graphviz below

1st excercise
-------------

Generated a custom theme based on seven built-in theme.
Using: "drupal generate:theme"
Named as: "Home Task Theme" - "home_task_theme"

Implemented the solution under home_task_theme_preprocess_page hook
To log all the required data:

- routeId, I assumed it's the Route Name attribute
- basic route, which I assumed could be Route Path attribute or the basic PathInfo attribute, so I included both of them. 

2nd excercise
-------------

Generated a new custom module
Using "drupal generate:module"
Named as: "Home Task" - "home_task"

Generated first_type and second_type content types by
Using: "drupal generate:entity:bundle"

Then I've created a new common field
Named as: Home Task Date
And added it into first_type and second_type as well.

Yaml configuration files could be found under:
modules/custom/home_task/config/install

3rd excercise
-------------

I've found a Drupal module called "Dependency Visualizer", which is fulfilling the expected solution and its latest version is compatible with Drupal 8.x, so I've decided to try out the solution.
https://www.drupal.org/project/dependency_visualizer

Installed "drupal/dependency_visualizer" and its dependency library "almende/vis" based on the given  instructions and Acitvited the plugin which is serving us on:
{HOST}/dependency_visualizer/visualize

Remainder, this is a Javascript based solution

I've developed my solution based on dependency_visualizer,
so I've used my home_task module - DefaultController and DefaultService to provide my graph visual on:
{HOST}/dependency_graph

Remainder, this is an Image generation (SVG) based solution

Used 3rd party modules:
1. https://packagist.org/packages/clue/graph
2. https://packagist.org/packages/graphp/graphviz
3. https://www.graphviz.org/

1st and 2nd modules will be provided by composer install

Graphviz
--------

3rd requires environment specific handling:

On Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions:
sudo apt install graphviz

On Windows ZIP should be downloaded and placed at local drive for example C:\Graphviz
https://www2.graphviz.org/Packages/stable/windows/10/msbuild/Release/Win32/graphviz-2.44.1-win32.zip

I've used Drupal Settings to provide path for the executable:
{APP_ROOT}sites/default/settings.local.php

Contains:
$settings['graph_viz_executable'] = 'C:\Graphviz\bin\dot.exe';

I've provided error handling and giving guidance when Windows specific or general Graphviz error appears
